## Description

The following information discribes the version 1 of RIF Enveloping. This version is based on the Gas Station Network (GSN) project (https://github.com/opengsn/gsn). In a nutshell, GSN abstracts away gas to minimize onboarding & UX friction for dapps. With GSN, gasless clients can interact with Ethereum contracts without users needing ETH for transaction fees. The GSN is a decentralized system that improves dapp usability without sacrificing security. 

RIF Enveloping expands the GSN capabilities and security model while reducing gas costs by:

- Securely deploying counterfactual SmartWallet proxies for each user account: this eliminates the need for relying on _msgSender() and _msgData() functions.
- Elimination of interaction with Uniswap: relay providers accumulate tokens on a paymaster under their control to later on decide what to do with funds.
- Reducing gas costs by optimizing the existing GSN architecture.

Our main objective is to provide the RSK ecosystem with the means to enable blockchain applications and end-users (wallet-apps) to pay for transaction fees using tokes, removing the need get RBTC.

The RIF Enveloping team is working on a new architecture to further reduce gas costs while simplifying the entire design of the solution. This changes will be part of the upcoming version 2.

It is important to mention that in version 1 the contracts deployed on Mainnet have as security measure **kill()**, **pause()** and **unpause()** functions and limits to the amount of RBTC that can be staked. These functions and limits will be removed in the upcoming version 2.

## Create a Smart Wallet

As mentioned before, the moment we need to use the Enveloping system, we have to deploy a Smart Wallet (SW). 

1. **Use your address to deploy a Smart Wallet (SW)**
```typescript
      const trxData: GsnTransactionDetails = {
        from: ownerEOA.address,
        to: customLogic,
        data: logicData,
        tokenRecipient: paymaster,
        tokenContract: token.address,
        tokenAmount: '10',
        factory: factory.address,
        recoverer: recoverer,
        index: walletIndex.toString(),
        paymaster: paymaster
      }

      const txHash = relayProvider.deploySmartWallet(trxData)
```

2. **Get your SW address**
```typescript
const swAddress = rProvider.calculateSmartWalletAddress(
factory.address,gaslessAccount.address, recoverer, customLogic, walletIndex, bytecodeHash)
//Using the same parameters as when SW was created.
```

## Changelog

## Gas Station Network

This project is based on GSN and expands its capabilities and security model while reducing gas costs. It does this by:
- Securely deploying counterfactual SmartWallet proxies for each user account: this eliminates the need for relying on _msgSender() and _msgData() functions.
- Elimination of interaction with Uniswap: relay providers accumulate tokens on a Verifier under their control to later on decide what to do with funds.

Code here is based on [Gas Stations Network](https://github.com/opengsn/gsn) (GSN). In a nutshell, GSN abstracts away gas to minimize onboarding & UX friction for dapps. With GSN, gasless clients can interact with Ethereum contracts without users needing ETH for transaction fees. The GSN is a decentralized system that improves dapp usability without sacrificing security.
